# Simple Code Editor (Clone of VS-Code)

  - A simple and user friendly code editor, with integrated terminal.
  - In technology stack, I used Electron and Monaco , same as used in VsCode Editor by Microsoft.
  - I learned how to integrated different Libraries and APIs into our project, and understand their existing code base.
